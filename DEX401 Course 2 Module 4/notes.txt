Routing Events
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Learned how to do async references using VM and sync using flow reference
- Routers send events to one of more groups of processors
- Choice
    - Route executed based on conditional logic
- First Successful
    - Routes executed sequentially until one successfully executes
- Round Robin
    - One route executed, which one is selected by iterating through a list maintained across executioins
- Scatter-Gather
    - All routes executed concurrently

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Multicasting Routes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Scatter gather sends the event to each route concurrently and returns a collection of all results
- Collection is an object of objects
    - Each object contains attributes and payload from each Mule event returned from a flow

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Route events based on conditions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Choice router sends the event to one route based on conditional logic
- The conditions are written in DataWeave

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Validating events
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Provide a way to test some conditions are met and throw an error if the validation fails
- Add the validation module
- Select a validation operation
